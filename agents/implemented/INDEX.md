## Template for New Entries

When documenting a completed feature:

```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD] Feature Name
**File:** [FEATURE_NAME.md](FEATURE_NAME.md)  
**Summary:** One-line description of what was built.  
**Changes:** Major files/modules affected.  
**Status:** ✅ Complete / ⚠️ Partial / 🔄 Ongoing
```

## Guidelines

1. Add entry immediately after completing a feature
2. Create detailed markdown file with implementation notes
3. Include: What, Why, How, Testing, Known Issues
4. Keep entries in reverse chronological order (newest first)
5. Update status if issues are discovered later
